# Aspirin

Aspirin is an Emacs distribution that aims to enhance the default Emacs experience. Aspirin alters a lot of the default settings, bundles a plethora of additional packages and adds its own core library to the mix. The final product offers an easy to use Emacs configuration for Emacs newcomers and lots of additional power for Emacs power users.  

Aspirin is compatible ONLY with GNU Emacs 26.3+. In general you're advised to always run Prelude with the latest stable Emacs release.
